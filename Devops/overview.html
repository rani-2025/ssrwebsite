    <p>
        1. Kernal - heart / brain of the OS - it talks to the hardware and manges everything
        2. Shell - this is like a translator - for eg when we type some thing shell will take instruction and sends to kernal
        3. boot loader - a small program that initializes and loads the operating system into a computer's memory when the computer is powered on
