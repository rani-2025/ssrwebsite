        <h2>old CICD pipeline</h2>
        compile - means convert high level language to machine understandable format (low level language)
        1.let say we have 100 files we cant copy all 100 files on to server..in an app (code, db, apis)
        2. they compiled into package (image) // build and integration team create package along with deployment instructions.. 
                                              // they will decide what needs to include and ignore etc...
        3. the operation  team -> take the package and deploy on server using given instructions
    its long process used to take some time

    cons - developer will get feed back after long time

        <h2>
            new CICD pipeline
        </h2>
        1. continuos integration - even small change will go through complete life cycle and new package generated 
        here copilation into package automated -- this is called build phase
        (in market we have build tools which helps to automate the process of transforming sourcode into runnable package by following these steps
        there are different softwares this might dependent on language use to write ur code, c# uses .net sdk)
        1. compile source code
        2. resolve / down load dependencies
        3. run unittests
        4. package application
        5. generate documentation
        5. statc code analyss and liniting
        6. deploy or publish artifacts
        )
        2. operation team trigger scrpts for deployment / else they create automated scripts to do this process called as continues delivery
        <img src="Assets/newCICDPipeline.png" alt = "new CICD pipeline"/>
        3. Different build tools in market- they have certain stards we should follow while creating build process

        <h2>
            Jenkins pipeline
        </h2>
        <img src="Assets/jenkinsintegration.png" alt="Jenkins integration" />
        in my project -> we used node.js laguage -> part of it  used webpack, node scripts for packaging, using Jenkins pipeline we will - continues integration (compile, sonarqube, veracode scan, check coverage, package(create artifact), store into artifactory (nexus) )
                    (recently people are moving github integration) -- this is called build phase
                    --> continues deployment (gitflux) to direct prod deployment --> called continuos deployment
                    --> if there is a manual intervention -- approval/merge called -- continues delivery
                    --> after continues monitoring --for any issues 

       in my work we do continues integration and delivery (here aws / cloud environment comes into picture) then continues monitoring will happen by SRE team
