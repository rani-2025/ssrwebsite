        <h2>old CICD pipeline</h2>
        compile - means convert high level language to machine understandable format (low level language)
        1.let say we have 100 files we cant copy all 100 files on to server..in an app (code, db, apis)
        2. they compiled into package (image) // build and integration team create package along with deployment instructions.. 
                                              // they will decide what needs to include and ignore etc...
        3. the operation  team -> take the package and deploy on server using given instructions
    its long process used to take some time

    cons - developer will get feed back after long time

        <h2>
            new CICD pipeline
        </h2>
        1. continuos integration - even small change will go through complete life cycle and new package generated 
        here copilation into package automated -- this is called build phase
        (in market we have build tools which helps to automate the process of transforming sourcode into runnable package by following these steps
        there are different softwares this might dependent on language use to write ur code, c# uses .net sdk)
        1. compile source code
        2. resolve / down load dependencies
        3. run unittests
        4. package application
        5. generate documentation
        5. statc code analyss and liniting
        6. deploy or publish artifacts
        )
        2. operation team trigger scrpts for deployment / else they create automated scripts to do this process called as continues delivery
        <img src="Assets/newCICDPipeline.png" alt = "new CICD pipeline"/>
        3. Different build tools in market- they have certain stards we should follow while creating build process

        <h2>
            Jenkins pipeline
        </h2>
        <img src="Assets/jenkinsintegration.png" alt="Jenkins integration" />
        in my project -> we used node.js laguage -> part of it  used webpack, node scripts for packaging, using Jenkins pipeline we will - continues integration (compile, sonarqube, veracode scan, check coverage, package(create artifact), store into artifactory (nexus) )
                    (recently people are moving github integration) -- this is called build phase
                    --> continues deployment (gitflux) to direct prod deployment --> called continuos deployment
                    --> if there is a manual intervention -- approval/merge called -- continues delivery
                    --> after continues monitoring --for any issues 

       in my work we do continues integration and delivery (here aws / cloud environment comes into picture) then continues monitoring will happen by SRE team

        <a href="https://github.com/puneetgavri/cicd-world/tree/main">install server and steps from Puneet notes</a>
        1. created a EC2 server on aws with some configuration
        2. install required softwares - use java commands from notes
        3. install maven  --> during compilation maven will read pom.xml -> go through all dependencies and download to local 
        when we do mvn clean - whole target folder will be deleted
        1. when we do install there was maven repository which will get create (.m2) it acts like local repo
        2. when you copile and package ur sourcode there was .war or .jar file will get created (as per laguage) this will sit under target folder - u can chec
        3. by default jenkins run on port 8080
        4.on ur instance we need to allow in security group then only it will allow trafic on jenkins 
        5. we can do lot of things with jenkins from the plugins --> when install jenkins select with default that itself has lot of options...
         install and configure plugins

        with Maven and jenkins we can achieve build and packaging.
        mavin make sure application should follow particular standards
        with maven everything needs to be taken care manually and also package deployed in m2 folder local environment.

        <p>
        with Jenkins we can automate all the process and we can store the package in cloud artifactory.
        similar to jenking we have gitlabs, github, circleCI, TravisCI also.
        by default jenkins run on port 8080, we can change port using configuration.
        once installed it will ask  to enter apssword with path, copy the path do cat "enter password".
        once done it will prompt to selected plugins to install or install suggested plugins --> select install suggested plugins
        cd /var/lib/jenkins# -> deafult jenkins path all plugins install here.
        once installation complete it will ask to create first admin user 
        then click on start using jenkins.
        eslint plugin also available will make code proper structure-> it does static code analysis ->proper folder , class names, spacing etc..
        if any errors will show warnings in a good visual way this also achievable with a plugin like warning
        plugin to check code coverage ->  coverage 

        dashboard -> manage jenkins -> tools -> u can configure which tool jenkins interact with 
        if already java installed -> command line -> echo JAva_home -> take the path and enter under java_home 
    
        git path configured by default

        mvn -> un select install automat -> since its already installed -> enter maven home by getting from terminal mvn path 

        with jenkins we use mavins to do packaging but here we have an option to automate the process.

        jenks -> managejenkins -> security -> add details > all created users saved on to jenkins path 
        in my company we used jenkins.

        in company we can login jenkins using company credentials thats possible by selecting ldap under  jenks -> managejenkins -> security
        after login what u can do or not define by authorization.

        under authorization ->select matrix based security u can visual representationyes

        jenks -> create project -> configure -> u can configure when it should run like the moment commit or periodic 
                here u have option to add build step using scripts / comman

        jenkins -> create pipeline -> where we define all comiplation steps -> 
        dashboard -> all -> new item -> pipeline -> create new -> mycipipeline -> theb do configure -> script -> u can define  steps under each stage 
        if u dont know select pipeline syntax -> add all options -> click on generate script -> copy that value and add under pipeline syntax 
        jenkins - u can even try with free style project as well

        jenkins -> install pipeline stage view plugin -> it will show graphical view of ur pipeline

        google -> jenkins plugin pipeline 

        its a oldest tool have lot of dependencies
        as soon as commited in github then jenkins job will be executed now a days comp not prefering jenkins 
        they are prefering latest tools like gitlabs, github actions
