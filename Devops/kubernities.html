            container orchestration - way to manage containers
        </h3>
        <p>
            docker inc - came with docker swam -> this helps container orchestration  (but dont waste time to learn)
            bcs now kuberneties created by google helps to manage container orchestration also it does lot of other things - its very popular
          </p>
        <p>
            <p> docker does basic things but to manage advance stuff we need other tools docker came up with docker swam now after kuberneties this become old</p>
            // kuberneties 
            in prod environments we deploy the app in mutiple containers 
            1. if any of container crashes other will serve as backup - self healing
            2. need a load balancer will distribute the traffic to all containers - load balancing
            3. let say traffic increases in peak time - we want automatically noof containers increases
            and decrease when not needed - auto scaling
            4. to manage the deployments
            5. advance networking 
        </p>

        <h3> Kuberneties(k8s) 
             - docker logo - ship carry containers , kubernities -> steering -> means kubernities carry orchestration of containers

        </h3>
        <p>
            <h3> users </h3>
            1. devops engineers - create/manage & deploy the app
            2. customers - people who uses the app

        </p>
        <p>
            we have following tools in market does container orchestration
                1. kuberneties // thus is very very popular
                2. aws ecs
                3. CNCF 
        </p>
        <p>
            containers are like mini server where my app is runnig
        </p>
        <p> 
            1. smallets unit in kubernities is called pod (pod word came from peas)
            2. mulitple containers can run in pod
            3. cluster -> contains one or more following nodes - > means its a group of servers
               a. control plane or master  -> manges cluster 
               b. data plane  -> where pods running (worker1)
               c. data plane  -> worker2
           4.  api server -> in control plane there is a component called api server- where all interactions happens
           between devops engineer and customers // its very imp
           5. devops engineers give commands using tool called kubeect (CLI) to api server 
           6. etcd -> source of truth -> it stores cluster state -> all node details, pod details etc...
           7. let say devops says -> using kubecet to api server-> i need 5 pods -> then etcd will strod this data
