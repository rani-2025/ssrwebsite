            container orchestration - way to manage containers
        </h3>
        <p>
            docker inc - came with docker swam -> this helps container orchestration  (but dont waste time to learn)
            bcs now kuberneties created by google helps to manage container orchestration also it does lot of other things - its very popular
          </p>
        <p>
            <p> docker does basic things but to manage advance stuff we need other tools docker came up with docker swam now after kuberneties this become old</p>
            // kuberneties 
            in prod environments we deploy the app in mutiple containers 
            1. if any of container crashes other will serve as backup - self healing
            2. need a load balancer will distribute the traffic to all containers - load balancing
            3. let say traffic increases in peak time - we want automatically noof containers increases
            and decrease when not needed - auto scaling
            4. to manage the deployments
            5. advance networking 
        </p>

        <h3> Kuberneties(k8s) 
             - docker logo - ship carry containers , kubernities -> steering -> means kubernities carry orchestration of containers

        </h3>
        <p>
            <h3> users </h3>
            1. devops engineers - create/manage & deploy the app
            2. customers - people who uses the app

        </p>
        <p>
            we have following tools in market does container orchestration
                1. kuberneties // thus is very very popular
                2. aws ecs
                3. CNCF 
        </p>
        <p>
            containers are like mini server where my app is runnig
            <p>
                kuberneties components 
                1. pods
                2. control plane - management - it has -> controll manager(cloud, node, volume, replication etc ..), api - server, etcd, kube schedular
                3. data plane  - working app - it contains->multiple pods, one kubelet, one CRI(container runtime interface), kube-proxy
            </p>
        </p>
        <p> 
            <h3> kuberneties architecture </h3>
            1. smallets unit in kubernities is called pod (pod word came from peas)
            2. mulitple containers can run in pod
            3. cluster -> contains one or more following nodes - > means its a group of servers
               a. control plane or master  -> manges cluster 
               b. data plane  -> where pods running (worker1)
               c. data plane  -> worker2
           4.  api server -> in control plane there is a component called api server- where all interactions happens
           between devops engineer and customers // its very imp
           5. devops engineers give commands using tool called kubeect (CLI) to api server 
           6. etcd -> source of truth -> it stores cluster state -> all node details, pod details, every signdle detail of cluster etc...
           7. let say devops says -> using kubecet to api server-> i need 5 pods -> then etcd will strod this data -> 
           api server will check etcd and send results to control manager-> then control manager(there are different control managerd) ->
           checks what user expects how many available (actual == desired) -> then these results send to api server -> kube schedular listens this
           and take care of creating pods -> using kublet schedular -> in data plane -> kublet agent interacts with api server to get details on pod specification details (images, network volume, port etc...) ->
           then it tells to CRI (container runtime interface) this gets data from docker interface and create the pods.
           kube proxy - is the one help to have communication between pods -> when user requested.
        </p>
        <p> when any request comes -> control plane -> api server -> authenticate -> then api server -> connect with etcd get the pod detaila </p>
        <p>

        <h3>different ways of deploying cluster - most popular is cloud</h3>
        following are ways - u can manage control plane and pods (most of the time we use cloud)
        1. kubeadm -> where the dev has control on the master and data plane. here dev has headache to manage everything.
        2. cloud (EKS, AKS, GKE ...) these are cloud managed services -> they will provide abstraction (u dont get as much of control like kubeadm) but it will take care of
        managing control plane.
        3. openshift - kind of kuberneties cluster 
        4. minikube, k3c etc ...
       </section>
    <section>
        <h3> different kubernuties commands </h3>
        1. go killercode
        -> select kubernetes 1.33 two node(here 2 node means control and data plane) 
        1. enter kubectl -> is the way to interact with api server
        2. kubectl get nodes -> list the number of nodes
        3. kubectl get nodes -> list the number of nodes -o wide -> give extra details on nodes 
        4. kubectl get pods -> will pull pod details
        5. kubectl run app1-pod --image=nginx:latest -> this will create app1-pod will be created 
        6. kubectl get pods -> give how many containers running in pod
        7. kubectl get pods -o wide -> gets more details on pod
        8. kubectl describe pod app1-pod -> it tells everything about the pod  ->  will say namespace default
        9.  kubectl run app1-pod --image=ngnx:latest -> let say if we gave wrong image name still it will create pod with image error.
        10. kubectl logs app1-pod -> gives the log
        11. kubectl exec -it app1-pod -- /bin/bash -> get u inside container of pod as a root user 
        12. exit -> back to control panel
