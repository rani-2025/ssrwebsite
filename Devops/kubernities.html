            container orchestration - way to manage containers
        </h3>
        <p>
            docker inc - came with docker swam -> this helps container orchestration  (but dont waste time to learn)
            bcs now kuberneties created by google helps to manage container orchestration also it does lot of other things - its very popular
          </p>
        <p>
            <p> docker does basic things but to manage advance stuff we need other tools docker came up with docker swam now after kuberneties this become old</p>
            // kuberneties 
            in prod environments we deploy the app in mutiple containers 
            1. if any of container crashes other will serve as backup - self healing
            2. need a load balancer will distribute the traffic to all containers - load balancing
            3. let say traffic increases in peak time - we want automatically noof containers increases
            and decrease when not needed - auto scaling
            4. to manage the deployments
            5. advance networking 
        </p>
       <section>
        <h3> Kuberneties(k8s) 
             - docker logo - ship carry containers , kubernities -> steering -> means kubernities carry orchestration of containers

        </h3>
        <p>
            <h3> users </h3>
            1. devops engineers - create/manage & deploy the app
            2. customers - people who uses the app

        </p>
        <p>
            we have following tools in market does container orchestration
                1. kuberneties // thus is very very popular
                2. aws ecs
                3. CNCF 
        </p>
        <p>
            containers are like mini server where my app is runnig
            <p>
                kuberneties components 
                1. pods
                2. control plane - management - it has -> controll manager(cloud, node, volume, replication etc ..), api - server, etcd, kube schedular
                3. data plane  - working app - it contains->multiple pods, one kubelet, one CRI(container runtime interface), kube-proxy
            </p>
        </p>
        <p> 
            <h3> kuberneties architecture </h3>
            1. smallets unit in kubernities is called pod (pod word came from peas)
            2. mulitple containers can run in pod
            3. cluster -> contains one or more following nodes - > means its a group of servers
               a. control plane or master  -> manges cluster 
               b. data plane  -> where pods running (worker1)
               c. data plane  -> worker2
           4.  api server -> in control plane there is a component called api server- where all interactions happens
           between devops engineer and customers // its very imp
           5. devops engineers give commands using tool called kubeect (CLI) to api server 
           6. etcd -> source of truth -> it stores cluster state -> all node details, pod details, every signdle detail of cluster etc...
           7. let say devops says -> using kubecet to api server-> i need 5 pods -> then etcd will strod this data -> 
           api server will check etcd and send results to control manager-> then control manager(there are different control managerd) ->
           checks what user expects how many available (actual == desired) -> then these results send to api server -> kube schedular listens this
           and take care of creating pods -> using kublet schedular -> in data plane -> kublet agent interacts with api server to get details on pod specification details (images, network volume, port etc...) ->
           then it tells to CRI (container runtime interface) this gets data from docker interface and create the pods.
           kube proxy - is the one help to have communication between pods -> when user requested.
        </p>
        <p> when any request comes -> control plane -> api server -> authenticate -> then api server -> connect with etcd get the pod detaila </p>
        <p>

        <h3>different ways of deploying cluster - most popular is cloud</h3>
        following are ways - u can manage control plane and pods (most of the time we use cloud)
        1. kubeadm -> where the dev has control on the master and data plane. here dev has headache to manage everything.
        2. cloud (EKS, AKS, GKE ...) these are cloud managed services -> they will provide abstraction (u dont get as much of control like kubeadm) but it will take care of
        managing control plane.
        3. openshift - kind of kuberneties cluster 
        4. minikube, k3c etc ...
       </section>
    <section>
        <h3> different kubernuties commands </h3>
        1. go killercode
        -> select kubernetes 1.33 two node(here 2 node means control and data plane) 
        1. enter kubectl -> is the way to interact with api server
        2. kubectl get nodes -> list the number of nodes
        3. kubectl get nodes -> list the number of nodes -o wide -> give extra details on nodes 
        4. kubectl get pods -> will pull pod details
        5. kubectl run app1-pod --image=nginx:latest -> this will create app1-pod will be created 
        6. kubectl get pods -> give how many containers running in pod
        7. kubectl get pods -o wide -> gets more details on pod
        8. kubectl describe pod app1-pod -> it tells everything about the pod  ->  will say namespace default
        9.  kubectl run app1-pod --image=ngnx:latest -> let say if we gave wrong image name still it will create pod with image error.
        10. kubectl logs app1-pod -> gives the log
        11. kubectl exec -it app1-pod -- /bin/bash -> get u inside container of pod as a root user 
        12. exit -> back to control panel 
    </section>
    <section>
       <h3> pod - namespace </h3>
        <p>
            by default pods get default namespaces
            kubectl get namespaces // list namespaces
            kubernaties specific namespaces started with -- kube
            // kube-node-lease, kube-public, kube-system
            kubectl get pods // get default namespace pods
            kubectl get pods --namespace kube-system // list down all pods running in kube-system namespace
            kubectl get pods --all-namespaces  // will give pods from all namespaces
            kubectl create namespace dev // will create dev namespace
            kubectl get ns // will get all namespaces
            kubectl create namespace test // will create test namespace
            kubectl run pod1 --image=nginx:latest --namespace dev // create pod1 in dev
            kubectl run pod2 --images=nginx:latest --namespace test // create pod2 in test
            kubectl get pods --namespace dev // get allpods from dev
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3> pod - labeling </h3>
        <p>
            1. label is an identifier for a pod 
            2. by default when create a pod it will give run=pod name
            3. kubectl get pods --show-labels // list all labels
            4. kubectl label pods app1-pod project=banking // here project banking kind of tagging resource
            5. kubectl get pods -l project=banking // will show all pods with this lable
            6. kubectl label pods pod1 project=ecomm --namespace dev // will show all pods with this lablel in dev
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>cluster - with auto healing</h3>

        1. kubectl api-resources // will show all the api resources
        2. deployment creates / manages the pods
        kubectl create deployment nginx-deploy --image=nginx:1.24 --replicas=3 // deployment will create 3 pods with default name under nginx-deploy name
        3. kubectl get deployment // will list all 3 pods
        4.kubectl delete pod podname // here get the pod from above list then pod will be deleted
        5. now do kubectl get deployment // again u will get 3 bcs deployment does auto healing
        6. kubectl create deployment nginx-deploy --image=nginx:1.24 --replicas=3 --namespace dev // it will 3 pods to dev namespaces if it exists else through an error
        7. kubectl get pods --show-labels --namespace -o dev // 
        8.kubectl get nodes // list all nodes like master, dataplan
        9. kubectl get deployment // list 3 pods
        10.kubectl scale deployment --replicas=5// u want increase no of pods // here it always manages 5 pods //scale out //auto scaling // increase the number of replicas
        11.kubectl scale deployment --replicas=2 // scale in // decrease the no of pods to 2
        12. kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deploy nginx=nginx:1.25 // here old pods deleted and new pods created with this latest image
        13. kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deploy // update to new image in deployment 
        14. kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deploy  // list down rollout history
        15. kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deploy // if any issues with roll out images we can undo like this
        // when pod deleted in deployment even it creates new pod but data will be lost

        <h3> manifest file -- never modify manifest file manually always use documentation do copy.. even in exam also they will provide doc</h3>
        <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/">kubereties documentation</a>
        <p>
            1.  its written in yml.
            2. manifest file is a declarative way of creating kubernative resources.
            3. u dont need to remember syntax.
            search kuberneties pods -> will gave a link where u can find manifest code as well
            4. use -> kubectl api-resources // it will list all kubernative resources
            5. in yml indentation place an important role - it should be proper case sensitive 
            6. in yml -if its list wii be started with -
            7. all commands will run through - kubectl
            8. kubectl get pods -o wide // will list all the pod details
            9. kubectl create deployment mydeployment ---image=nginx:latest replicas=3 // it will create mydeployment with 3 pods
            10. in manifest -> kind is what kind of manifest (e.g -pods / deployement)
            11. in manifest meatadata - details about kind
            12. kubectl scale deployment mydeployment --replicas=5 // using this command we can increase the number of pods
            13. how to do this in manifest file -> go to ur deployment.yml and update replicas count

        </p>
        <p>
          <h3> create multiple containers using metafile</h3>
          <p>
            1. create vi multi.yml
            2. kubectl apply -f multi.yml 
            3. kubectl get pods -o wide // will list all pods
            4. curl 192.168.1.5:80 // to access app in pod .. it wont access from browser only with in cluster u can aceess
          </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3> services</h3>

            1. let say create 1 node(13.14.15.6) with 2 pods -> when pod created it will create with an ip (e.g - 10.0.1, 10.0.2)
            2. let say create 2 node(14.14.15.6) with 2 pods -> when pod created it will create with an ip (e.g - 11.0.1, 11.0.2)
            3. here after deployment step 4 with curl command u access app 
            4. in real time we dont expose ips to everyone. this can be achieved through load balancer where load balancer have single ip which will distribute traffic.
            5. let say one pod failed 10.0.1 then replica will creare another pod of 10.0.3 now how load balancer knows the new IP.
            
            <p>This is where services going to help.
                they do load balance
                expose application to outside of world.
                this will use labels to distribute the traffic.
                e.g - here load balancer and all pods can  use labels like -> env:dev then services will made to distribute using this label  
            </p>
            <p>
                there are 3 type of services
                1. cluster IP (default)
                2. Nodeport
                3. Load balancer

                kubectl get service -> see the cluster ip service details
                curl 10.96.236.2:80 // to will give pod name but not ip address 

                i can give my client to cluster IP that will take care of ditributing traffic to multiple pods

                services will identify through labels and selectors.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>cluster IP service</h3>
                <p>
                    cluster ip can help only the people inside the cluster. some one outside cant use.
                    this only use for internal communication.

                    front end ip pod will send request to cluster IP then it will take care of distributing backend pods.
                    since cluster ip cant access outside world thats what we want with back end pods. so it will be helpful in these usecases.

                    kubectl get services // will give u all services 
                    kubctl describe service clipservice // will give endpoints along with detialed info on clipservice-- where which pods will serve behind this 
                    in manifest file if no type of service given means its cluster
                </p>
            </p>
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>node port service</h3>
        node port cluster -> people from outside cluster also can access node if their port falls with in defiled node port cluster range
        1. this will be accessed through only by accessing server ip from browser so u end up exposing server ip outside
        2. e.g the node accessing outside crashed then new node with ip will be replaced also draw back
        3. port range difficult to remember to access node u need to use physical server ip which is common : port id (this is from prot range)
        </section>
        <section>
            with load balancer we can resolve issues of node part but if noof microservices increases cost will increase bcs each microservice we need to buy load balanceservices
        
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Nginx - Ingress controller -> Ingress service smart way of accessing the pods</h3>
            <p>
             1. internally uses load balancer - outside its url based 10.0.01/app1,10.0.01/app2 like 
             2. different type of ingress controllers- gives cluster advanced capabilitues i.e - path based routing
             3. multiple ways to install - manifest 
             4. ingress comes with 2 components - ingress controller, ingress service 
             5. ingress controller -> will check ingress rules - based on it traffic disributes
             6.eksctl - with single command we can create everything
