        <h2>Docker Notes</h2>
        <p>
             1. container is mini server on its own it contain all required softwares to run the app it can be installed on any server.
             2. Hypervisor -> a program used to run and manage one or more virtual machines on a computer/ its a software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs).
             3. vm is rented by datacenters in cloud environment - starting and stopping server time taking, backup of vm also expensive, 
             4. we can use vm in a better way using containeration -- we can create multiple containers on one vm --> they share vm's OS container doesnt have any OS ->
             container backup image will be created in articatory
             backup of container doesnt contain OS only contain libraries to run the app.
             5. vm -> everything been packaged in a image 
             6. docker desktop is software - contains a light weight virtual machine to run linux kernal
            
        </p>

            <h3> steps to create docker instance </h3>
            <p>
                1. create ec2 instance on amazon / azure vm
                2. install docker engine - https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ - go to ubuntu - since ec2 instance on it.
                3. install docker packages 
                4. docker ps -> command gives u how many containers running
                5. if i dont want to use sudo docker ps again again
                6. sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu -> this command will add ubuntu user to the docker session (ag means - adding to group)
                7. docker images -> will list all docker images - after immediate u dont see anything here get docker image from one of artifactory e.g - docker hub
                8. docker hub -> is the global container having set of already existing images -> u can see jenkins image also here
                9. docker pull nginx -> will pull nginx image / docker pull jenkins -> then jenkins will be downloaded on ec2 instanse filesystem/ then run -> docker images -> it will show downloaded image
                10. docker run -it -> command will run container in interactive mode
                11. docker run -it --name c1 nginx /bin/bash -> here c1 container created by pulling nginx from docker hub image then it will enter into c1 container ,
                /bin/bash  -- will open terminal in container -- here if we dont do docker pull and execute run command directly then it will pull from docker hub then istall 
                12. run exit command here to exit from container
                12. now it created a container -> u can install anything u want
                13. docker ps -a -> will give all the containers which are active or not as well / docker ps -> list only active once
                14. docker images -> will list all images
                docker rmi "imageid" // image id from above command - will delete the container
                15. we can't create container without any image
                16. docker run -dt --name c1 ubuntu - it will run the command in detach mode, in dt mode i can run multiple containers
                17. docker exec -it c2 bash -> it will take u again into c2 container (Exec - exit current process and enter into c2)
                18. docker exec c3 df -h (exec 'container name' then add what ever the command u want to execute in that container)
                19.docker run --it --name c4 nginx -> after installation
                curl http://localhost:80 -> will hit nginx --> 
                if i want to access from out side machine -> then we need to do port mapping between container and ec2 instance -> then using ec2 IP we can access outside
                20. docker run -dt --name test11 portmappedcontainer -p 8000:80 nginx -> using container created with port mapping after this allow port using security group as below
                21.edit inboundrules on ec2-> custom tcp -> add 8000 -> then with ec2IP:8000 -> we can access nginx -> this will serve nginx from container 
                22. while creating container only we have to do port mapping (8000 is random port)
                23. to restart docker - docker start c2
                24. docker rm c2 -> to remove docker container - we cant remove running container -> but we can kill - docker kill c2 - will remove / kill running container as well
                25. to do all these we need to create account in docker hub 
                26. if wants to create a container from running image 
                docker commit c1 appleimage ->  its called custom image
                push ur custom image to docker hub repository by using following command(follow -> 27 to 29 steps)
                27. in ur dockerhub -> repositories -> create repository -> 
                docker tag appleimage(imagename):latest(by default latest else give version) punnetguari/mywebsite(docerhub repo name):v1 (image name)

                28. docker login -u punnetguari (username) -> then it will prompt password
                29. docker push punnetguari/mywebsite:v1 -> it will push v1 image
                push container image (follow steps 30 -> 31)
                30. docker container c1 punnetguari/mywebsite:new 
                31. docker push punnetguari/mywebsite:new
                32. docker images are builtin layers -> when we pull image that image has multiple layers will be downloaded automatically
                32. go killercoda.com select -> playground -> ubuntu -> we have already docker instlled -> 
                we can practice any commands -> its free environment with all platforms
                33. few times images are very large then use -> docker pull alpine-> to make lighter 
                34. ephemeral -> is a temporary storage it will be wipe our when we kill or remove container --> container doesnt have its own storage it will shared from ec2 instanse
                35.creating a docker volumme -> docker volume create my_volume -> its a logical volume 
                docker run -td --name c1 -v my_volume:/data ubuntu --> it will create logical volume at data directory -> that means what ever created under data directory getting stored in my volume
                when we dont specify my volume then it will store in overlay folder
                we can share same volume with multiple containers
                36. let say in ec2 instance -> pwd -> list all directories
                    1. creating a folder1 -> mkdir folder1, do cd folder1, create -> touch dev-config.text, qa-cofig.tx
                    2. create container -> docker run -td --name c1 -v /folder1:/data ubuntu -> here data directory on container mapped with ec2 folder1 -> this is called bind mount here container and host folders are tightly coupled
                    not recommanded rather docker volume map is recommanded option 

                37. custom image will be created using -> docker exec -it c2 bash-> then -> docker commit c2 my_image
                38. create custom image with step by step approach -> // this is to help to create custom image with automation steps with all commands what ever requires
                     1. v1 Dockerfile // open dockerfile
                     2. cat Dockerfile
                        FROM ubuntu // ubuntu is a base image this is mandatory .. u can use jenkins what ever u want
                        RUN apt update && apt install -y phython3
                        RUN touch hello.txt
                        COPY file1.txt 
                        VOLUME v1
                        docker build -t appleimage .

                this will create appleimage with all these steps.

                now u can create container from this appleimage 
                docker run -it --name applecont appleimage (by default it goes to root directory)

                39. another custom image creation with steps
                
                FROM appleimage
                    WORKDIR /tmp --> from root to cd /tmp here
                    RUN echo "hello"

                once save exit run
                docker build -t bananaimage // this will create bananaimage

                40. as a devops engineer u will be creating dockerfile --> its very very important

        <h3>docker compose</h3>
        <p>
            <p>
                let say in real time app - u have UI, businees logic, DB layer all three needs to interacted and deployed 
                instead repeating commands to create container for each

                we can achieve throguh docker compose
                this can be achieved through yml -> here we write all the code  in a declarative way to get all the apps and deploy
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3> creating yml file</h3>
                <p>
                    YML stands for YAML Ain't Markup Language (originally "Yet Another Markup Language")
                    YAML is a human-readable data serialization standard commonly used for:
                    Configuration files
                    Docker Compose files
                    Kubernetes manifests
                    CI/CD pipelines
                    API specifications
                    It uses indentation and simple syntax to represent data structures like lists, dictionaries, and key-value pairs.
                </p>
                e.g -> we have this docker command ->
                1. docker volume create myvol
                2. docker network create --driver bridge mynet
                docker run -td --name c1 --network mynetwork -p 8081:80 -v myvol:/data ubuntu

                in yml all these converted into strcture way
                1. create yml file -> vi compose.yml
                2. docker-compose up -> it will execute all commands -> u dont need to give in same order automatically this command take care order of tags
                3. in yml we need to add depends on if something depends on others to create e.g create db before -> then under web write depends-on:db
                4. in yml file indentation is very important.
                  e.g u need to created -> services: db: image
                  services: // for each child give one identation
                   db:
                    image: ubuntu 

                5. this is how u can identation in yml using vscode ->
                        Enable "Format on Save" in VS Code settings
                        Set default formatter to Prettier for YAML files
                        Configure tab size to 2 spaces for YAML

            container orchestration - way to manage containers
        </h3>
        <p>
            docker inc - came with docker swam -> this helps container orchestration  (but dont waste time to learn)
            bcs now kuberneties created by google helps to manage container orchestration also it does lot of other things - its very popular
          </p>
        <p>
            <p> docker does basic things but to manage advance stuff we need other tools docker came up with docker swam now after kuberneties this become old</p>
            in prod environments we deploy the app in mutiple containers 
            1. if any of container crashes other will serve as backup - self healing
            2. need a load balancer will distribute the traffic to all containers - load balancing
            3. let say traffic increases in peak time - we want automatically noof containers increases
            and decrease when not needed - auto scaling
            4. to manage the deployments
            5. advance networking 
        </p>
       <section>
        <h3> Kuberneties </h3>
        <p>
            we have following tools in market does container orchestration
                1. kuberneties // thus is very very popular
                2. aws ecs
                3. CNCF

                <h3>what is virtualization?</h3>
                its a process of running multiple virtual systems or resources on top of single physical machine. resources could be OS , software, storgae, network etc..
                adv - 
                reduce spending on intial server setup.
                faster setup time
                resources utilized more efficiently
                easily to scale and maintain.
            </p>
            <p>
                1. what is Docker?
                a. its a containeration tool.
                b. it can be used to create custom images.
                c. it can be used to containerize and pack the entire dependencies / libraries.

                2. why docker is required?
                sometimes everyone is not having same kind of configuration in that case we can use docker.

                3. what is EC2 instance?
                Ec2 instance is a virtual server created in AWS cloud with requested configuration.
                we use this to install all required softwares to run my application.

            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>what is containerization? </h3>
                <p>
                    1. its on OS-level virtualization method used to deploy and run distributed applications with out launching an entire VM for each app.
                    2. with containers, all the environment issues were solved. The developer could easily wrap their code in a leightweight container and pass on to operations team.
                    adv - they are not resource hungry 
                    they are leightweight and hence portable.
                    they are developer friendly and can be configured through the code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Containerization tools? </h3>
                     1. mesos 
                     2. rkt
                     3. docker

                     docker is the most famous among all

                <p>
                    <h3>  what is docker? </h3>
                    <p>
                        docker is a computer program that performs os level - virtualization, also known as "containerization".
                        first release in 2013 developed by docker Inc. 

                        docker is used to run software packages called "containers."

                        docker written in go language which is from google.
                    </p>
                    <h3> docker lifecycle?</h3>
                    <p>
                        docker engine pull the image docker hub
                        create container based on the image
                        then manage run, start , stop of containers.
                    </p>
                    <h3> components of docker eco system </h3>
                    <p>
                        docker hub - public docker registry
                        docker engine -its heart of docker eco system,  responsible for managing and running containers, 
                                       store custom docker images,works on top of os level, utlizes kernal of the underlying OS.
                        docker images - containers created based on it, its free and public, its like a template of a container, its created in layers, 
                                        any new change in image results in creating a new layer.
                                        one can launch multiple containers from a single docker image.
                        containers -    its a lightweight software environment.
                                        works on top of underlying OS kernal.
                                        its small in size and highly portable.
                                        created using docker image.
                                        they cant persist the data.
                                        to persist data we use docker volume.
                        docker volumes - this is to persist data.
                                         it can connect to multiple containers simultaniously.
