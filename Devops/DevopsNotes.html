  <h3> waterfall model vs Agile? </h3>
 <p>
 here a scenario
 1. Citi bank wants to develop car loan app
 2. they will hire infosys
 3. they will meet on zoom for a planning call
 4. then there are meetings will be conducted on planning and analysis
 5. once all analysis complete they freeze the requirements
 6. then infy will come with some design
 7. then citi bank go and check all ok or any changes
 8. once all finalized then start implementation 
 9. then inside infy lot of testing will happen
 10. after all done citi will do relase and do publicity
 11.but citi doesnt know the product well until testing complete in water fall model.(
  water fall model go one direction from requiremts-> design-> development -> testing -> deployment -> maintanance (no feed  back machanism)
  after a while and world of cloud this doesnt work 
 )
 12. where as in agile they will get regular feedbacks and make changes. (here is for eg there are 4 models in app - after one monthe model 1  infy will get feedback from model, they srart model 2 at parallel they will work on model 1)

  <h3>what is devops</h3>
  <p>
    let say in infy development completes he needs to deploy on server that will take care by sys  admin
    here dev maangaer different from sys admin mgr, sys admin doesnt know what changes done by dev they both had a conflict got delayed for deployments

    here is what devops - its methodology where - Dev + ops team together under same maangaer (means dev + sysadmin in same team)
    delivering high quality product quickly by learn multiple tools.
    <img src="/Assets/Devops/whatisDevops.png" alt = "devops"/>
   here is what multiple tools
   developer - use version control (git and github) to push the changes -> then create CI/CD pipeline using (Jenkins) > then create containers comes under (Kubernetes) -> 
   IAC(infrastructure as code) -> (Terrafom)-> Configmanagement is (Ansible)
   -> monitoring (EF stack)
    
  </p>
  <h3> what is version control system? </h3>
 <p>
  A Version Control System (VCS) is a software tool that helps developers track and manage changes to a project's codebase over time. 
  we can keep history of changes and revert to particular version as needed.
  it allows mutliple people to colloborate, keep a history of changes, revert earliar versions if needed.
 </p>
 <p>
  <h3> Different Architecture  (type of) version control systems? </h3>
  1. Local VCS  - install on local machine - if its fails then we loose all - this is called - GIT
  2. Central VCS - managed through central storage - this is called - GIT Hub 
  3. disctributed VCS  - local verion control connected to central called distributed
 </p>
 <p>
  Package manager install s/w + dependendencies
  1. install git
  apt install git (on linux)
  2. then configure git -> configure git
  git config --global user.name
