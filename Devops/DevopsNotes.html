  <h3> waterfall model vs Agile? </h3>
 <p>
 here a scenario
 1. Citi bank wants to develop car loan app
 2. they will hire infosys
 3. they will meet on zoom for a planning call
 4. then there are meetings will be conducted on planning and analysis
 5. once all analysis complete they freeze the requirements
 6. then infy will come with some design
 7. then citi bank go and check all ok or any changes
 8. once all finalized then start implementation 
 9. then inside infy lot of testing will happen
 10. after all done citi will do relase and do publicity
 11.but citi doesnt know the product well until testing complete in water fall model.(
  water fall model go one direction from requiremts-> design-> development -> testing -> deployment -> maintanance (no feed  back machanism)
  after a while and world of cloud this doesnt work 
 )
 12. where as in agile they will get regular feedbacks and make changes. (here is for eg there are 4 models in app - after one monthe model 1  infy will get feedback from model, they srart model 2 at parallel they will work on model 1)

  <h3>what is devops</h3>
  <p>
    <li>
      <h3>devops credentials</h3>
      devops course will be taught on aws account as its free account
      <p>https://aws.amazon.com/</p>
      <p><strong>email:</strong> rlearnings24@gmail.com</p>
      <p><strong>uname:</strong> sandyaws</p>
      <p><strong>Password:</strong> CristLane2025!</p>

  </li>
  </p>
  <p>
    let say in infy development completes he needs to deploy on server that will take care by sys  admin
    here dev maangaer different from sys admin mgr, sys admin doesnt know what changes done by dev they both had a conflict got delayed for deployments

    here is what devops - its methodology where - Dev + ops team together under same maangaer (means dev + sysadmin in same team)
    delivering high quality product quickly by learn multiple tools.
    <img src="/Assets/Devops/whatisDevops.png" alt = "devops"/>
   here is what multiple tools
   developer - use version control (git and github) to push the changes -> then create CI/CD pipeline using (Jenkins) > then create containers comes under (Kubernetes) -> 
   IAC(infrastructure as code) -> (Terrafom)-> Configmanagement is (Ansible)
   -> monitoring (EF stack)
    
  </p>
  <h3> what is version control system? </h3>
 <p>
  A Version Control System (VCS) is a software tool that helps developers track and manage changes to a project's codebase over time. 
  we can keep history of changes and revert to particular version as needed.
  it allows mutliple people to colloborate, keep a history of changes, revert earliar versions if needed.
 </p>
 <p>
  <h3> Different Architecture  (type of) version control systems? </h3>
  1. Local VCS  - install on local machine - if its fails then we loose all - this is called - GIT
  2. Central VCS - managed through central storage - this is called - GIT Hub 
  3. disctributed VCS  - local verion control connected to central called distributed
 </p>
 <p>
  Package manager install s/w + dependendencies
  1. install git
  apt install git (on linux)
  2. then configure git -> configure git
  git config --global user.name

  <h3> few git helpfulcommands</h3>

   rm        Remove files from the working tree and from the index

examine the history and state (see also: git help revisions)
   bisect    Use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug
   diff      Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
   grep      Print lines matching a pattern
   log       Show commit logs
   show      Show various types of objects
   status    Show the working tree status

grow, mark and tweak your common history
   branch    List, create, or delete branches
   commit    Record changes to the repository
   merge     Join two or more development histories together
   rebase    Reapply commits on top of another base tip
   reset     Reset current HEAD to the specified state
   switch    Switch branches
   tag       Create, list, delete or verify a tag object signed with GPG

collaborate (see also: git help workflows)
   fetch     Download objects and refs from another repository

  1.install git from https://git-scm.com/downloads
  2. mkdir myproj, cd myproj

  <h3>  git commands </h3>
  <a href="https://github.com/discover-devops/Git_Commands/blob/main/01_GItRest_Introduction.md">kumar trainer git notes</a>
 
  1. git branch is a powerful feature that allows create an independent line of development branch- seperate from main/master  branch.
  2. after commitng changes you can do ... 
  git log 
  it will show the commit id and the branch name.

  1. after creatig directory do .. git init -- initialization
  1. git branch
  2. ls -- show all lines added
  3. cat story.txt - create file if not there else show the content if its there
  4. echo "hello" > story.txt
  5. git add story.txt (to stage the changes)
  6. git commit -m "updated" (to commit changes)
  4. git diff master featurebranch
  5. git merge faturebranch 
  6. while merging featutre branch into master if no new changes in master then git does fast forward /linear merge ..
  here u can see same commitID bcs no changes made in between
  7. while merging if there is a change on same line from master and feture one - 
  then git will complain there is a conflict
  8. vi story.txt will open file and show conflict.. then Update as per
  9.wq! - will save and exit.. then do git commit to push (this is called three way merge)
  10. git log -- it will show both commit nos 
  7. git branch -d featurebranch -- will delete branch
  8. revert the changes ->
     a) soft --> git reset --soft (git reset --soft HEAD~1) -- WILL RESET to that staging level just to confirm
     git restore <file> to discard changes in working dir -- this will discard changes
     b) mixed -->  git reset --mixed (git )
     c) hard --> git reset --hard

  9. let say u have commit 1, 2, 3 --> if u do revert on commit 2 -> 4th commit have 3rd commit exclude 2
  10. let say u have commit 1, 2, 3 --> if u do reset on commit 2 -> it will go back to commit 1 both 2 & 3 will be excluded means go to initial version
