    <section>
        declaration of state in react.
        usestate allows component to have its own state
        <pre>
            <code>
        import {useState} from React;
        const LightSwitch = () => {
            const [lightOn, setLightOn] = useState(false);
            function handleLight () {
                setLightOn(!lightOn)
            }

            return(
                <h1> Light is turned on: {lightOn}</h1>
                <button onClick={ () => {setLightOn(!lightOn)}}</button> > or
                <button onClick={ handleLight } ></button>
            )
        }

       <h3> Managing state in react </h3> 
       with in using usestate
       if its across we can manage through global state  which is called useContext
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>
            prop drilling is a situation where you are passing data from a parent to a child component, then to a grandchild component, and so on, until it reaches a more distant component further down the component tree, where this data is required
        </p>

        <h3>stateful vs stateless components</h3>
       1.  stateful component maintain the state in component
       2. stateless component doesnt maintain any state this will read state through props
       3.  props cant be changes, where as state does -- state will be created using useState or useContext
       4. we can create global state using usecontext where usestate is local to component  
       5. this is how we can create state and pass as prop, if u need to update then declare setFruits
       <pre>
        <code>
            export function App() {
                const [fruits] = React.useState([
                      {fruitName: 'apple', id: 1},
                      {fruitName: 'apple', id: 2},
                      {fruitName: 'plum', id: 3},
                 ]);
                return (
                  <div className="App">
                    <h1>Where should the state go?</h1>
                    <Fruits fruits={ fruits }/>
                    <FruitsCounter fruitscount={ fruits.length }/>
                  </div>
                );
              }
        </code>

    <h3> what is state in react?</h3>
    <p>
        1. state is a dynamic storage that holds data that may change  over lifetime of a component.
        2. we can import state using :  import { useState } from 'react'.
        3. In React, the state is described as immutable that means - state cant be changes directly; updates must be made using a special function.
        4. const [greeting, setGreeting] = React.useState('Hello world');
