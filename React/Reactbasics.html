        <h2>Event Handling</h2>
        <p>
            In React, event handling is achieved through JSX event attributes, similar to HTML event attributes in JavaScript. 
            For example, the click event handling attribute is:
            - In JSX: <code>onClick</code>
            - In JavaScript: <code>onclick</code>
        </p>

        <p>
            When you assign <code>onClick={handleClick}</code>, you are passing the function itself as a reference. 
            React will then call this function when the click event occurs. However, if you use <code>onClick={handleClick()}</code>, 
            the function <code>handleClick</code> is executed immediately, and its return value (which is often <code>undefined</code> if 
            the function doesn't explicitly return anything) is assigned to the <code>onClick</code> handler. This leads to the function running 
            on every render and not when the button is clicked.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sample code:
            <pre>
                <code>
function MyComponent() {
  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log('Button was clicked!');
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}> {/* Correct way */}
      Click me
    </button>
  );
}
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>

            <h3> how to embed expressions in string</h3>
            The symbol ` is called a backtick or grave accent. In JSX (and JavaScript in general), it is used to define template literals.
            Template literals allow you to embed expressions within strings. 
            
            Here's how it works:
            <pre> //  preformatted text. It preserves both spaces and line breaks exactly as they are written in the HTML code.
                <code> // this is add inline code  or a fragment of computer code. it displays monospaced font to differentiate it from normal text
                    let randomNum = 5;
                    let userInput = 3;

                    let message = `Computer number: ${randomNum}, Your guess: ${userInput}`;
                    console.log(message); 
                </code>
            </pre> // ideal for display code example in readable format
            here to embed randonNumber and userInput expressions we used backtick. 
        </p>

        <h3> traditional app navigation</h3>
        scenario - 1
        Before the advent of modern JavaScript frameworks, most websites were implemented as multi-page applications. That is, when a user clicks on a link, the browser navigates to a new webpage, sends a request to the web server; this then responds with the full webpage and the new page is displayed in the browser.
        This can make your application resource intensive to the Web Server. CPU time is spent rendering dynamic pages and network bandwidth is used sending entire webpages back for every request. If your website is complex, it may appear slow to your users, even slower if they have a slow or limited internet connection.

        scenario -2 
        You have a web application that has a navigation bar on top and two pages. One page shows the latest news, and the other shows the current user’s profile page. The navigation bar contains a link for each page.
        In a traditional website, when the user clicks the Profile link, the web browser sends the request to the web server. The web server generates the HTML page and sends it back to the web browser. The web browser then renders the new web page.

        To solve this problem, many web developers develop their web applications as Single Page Applications.
       </section>
       <section>
        <h3>Single page navigation </h3>
        scenario -1
        Youre using many Single Page Applications every day. Think of your favorite social network, or online email provider, or the map application you use to find local businesses. Their excellent user experiences are driven by Single Page Applications.
        A Single Page Application allows the user to interact with the website without downloading entire new webpages. Instead, it rewrites the current webpage as the user interacts with it. The outcome is that the application will feel faster and more responsive to the user.
       
        scenario - 2
        In a Single Page Application, different pages are broken into templates (or views). Each view will have HTML code containing variables that can be updated by the application.
        The web browser sends the request to the web server, and the web server sends back a JSON object. The web browser then updates the web page by inserting the template with the variables replaced by the values in the JSON object.    
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Anchor Tag Elements in Single-Page Elements</h3>
        <p>
            A single-page application can’t have regular anchor tag elements as a traditional web app can. 
            The reason for this is that the default behavior of an anchor tag is to load another HTML file from a server and refresh the page. This page refresh is not possible in a SPA that's powered by a library such as React because a total page refresh is not the way that a SPA works, as explained earlier in this lesson item. 
            Instead, a SPA comes with its own special implementation of anchor tags and links, which only give an illusion of loading different pages to the end user when in fact, they simply load different components into a single element of the real DOM into which the virtual DOM tree gets mounted and updated.   
        </p>
        <p>
            What is package-lock.json?
            It’s a file automatically generated by npm when you run npm install.

            It locks the exact versions of every installed package (and its dependencies), ensuring that everyone who installs your project gets the same exact dependency tree — no surprises. 

        </p>

    <section>
        <h3> project root level - (npmrc) file</h3>
        <p> 
            The .npmrc file is a configuration file used by npm (Node Package Manager) to manage settings for installing packages and interacting with npm registries. 
            It allows you to customize behavior globally, per project, or per user.
            Here are some common keys you might find:


            Setting	Description
            1. registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/	Sets the default registry
            2. strict-ssl=true	Ensures SSL is used
            3. authToken=xxxx	For private registry authentication
            4. save-exact=true	Always save exact versions in package.json
            5. legacy-peer-deps=true	Ignores peer dependency conflicts (helpful in npm v7+)
            6.  cache=/path/to/cache	Custom cache directory
            7. scripts-prepend-node-path=true	Ensures correct node is used in scripts
            8. always-auth = true (npm sends your auth token or credentials with every request to the registry) - (few times)

        </p>
        <p>
            In curent org we have
            registry = "https://maven.infra.dp-dev.jcpcloud2.net/content/groups/npm/" (nexus registry)
            cafile=trustedcerts (This setting points to a PEM-encoded certificate file (often .pem, .crt, or .cer) that npm should trust when making secure HTTPS connections)
            package-lock=false (This tells npm NOT to create or use package-lock.json at all.
            It won’t generate a package-lock.json when you run npm install
            If one already exists, npm will ignore it
            This also disables features like npm ci (which depends on the lock file))

        <h3> project root level (eslintrc) file</h3>
        <p>
            if you see an .eslintrc in node_modules, it's likely from an ESLint configuration package, <br>
            but you'd usually maintain your own .eslintrc at the root of your project.
            <ul>
            <li>An .eslintrc file in a React project (or any JavaScript/Node.js project) is a configuration file for ESLint, 
                which is a static code analysis tool used to identify and fix problems in JavaScript code. 
                This file is essential for ensuring that the code follows certain style guidelines, best practices, and avoids errors.</li>

            <h3>What does the .eslintrc file do? </h3>
            <li>Linting Configuration: It specifies the rules ESLint should follow while analyzing the code. 
                For example, it can define rules like "always use semicolons" or "indent using 2 spaces."</li>

           <li>Code Quality: It can enforce consistent coding styles and conventions across a team, 
            making the codebase easier to read, maintain, and debug.</li>

          <li> Error Prevention: ESLint helps prevent bugs by catching common mistakes, 
            such as declaring a variable but not using it, or using a console.log statement in production code.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3> we have following settings in our project each setting means</h3>
    <ul>
       <li> "default-param-last": "off": Disables the rule that enforces default parameters to come last in function signatures.</li>

        <li>"react/function-component-definition": "off": Disables the rule that enforces a specific style (declaration vs. expression) for React function components.</li>

        <li>"prefer-regex-literals": "off": Disables the rule that encourages using regular expression literals over the RegExp constructor.</li>
      </ul>

        <h3>stateful vs stateless components</h3>
       1.  stateful component maintain the state in component
       2. stateless component doesnt maintain any state this will read state through props
       3.  props cant be changes, where as state does -- state will be created using useState or useContext
       4. we can create global state using usecontext where usestate is local to component  
       5. this is how we can create state and pass as prop, if u need to update then declare setFruits
       <pre>
        <code>
            export function App() {
                const [fruits] = React.useState([

        Conditional rendering
    </h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>
           State is all the data your app is currently working with. With this in mind, 
           you can decide to conditionally render specific components in your app, based on whether specific state data has specific values. 
           To make this possible, React works with the readily available JavaScript syntax and concepts.

            The output of the CurrentMessage component will depend on what the received value of the day variable is. 
            On the condition of the day variable having the value of any number between 1 and 5 (inclusive), 
            the output will be the contents of the Workdays component. Otherwise, 
            on the condition of the day variable having the value of either 6 or 7, 
            the output will be the contents of the Weekends component.
