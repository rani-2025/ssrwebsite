      <p>

        1. class A - range 10.0.0.8 (office generally we have)
        2. class b
        3. class c - for home network - 192

        1. example with above formulas for following ip
        192.168.0.8/29

        Binary - 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111000
        Subnetmask - 255.255.255.248
        Wildcard - 0.0.0.7
        First ip address -192.168.0.8
        Second ip address - 192.168.0.15

      </p>

      <h3> vnet creation</h3>
      in Azure world VM's connect through vNet

    </section>

    <h3> vNET peering</h3>
     if we want to connect one vnet to another vnet is called vnet pairing.
     1. here scenario how it pairs
     steps - 1 vnet create in india
     2. vnet in east
     3. one in india

     when vnet pairing with 2 different regions then that is called global vnet peering
     if 2 vnets in same regions then thats called vnetpairing -- that happens through private networking
     Private IP communication between VNets in the same region is cost-effective and does not incur additional charges for the network traffic itself.

     Public IP communication incurs costs for public IP addresses (static or dynamic) and egress data transfer to the public internet.

     If you expose Azure resources to the public internet using public IPs, you need to factor in additional charges for public IP addresses and outbound data traffic.
   
     we have static and dynamic IP if we shutdown dynamic ip will change but static ip wont change

     by default when u create vm it will create private with dynamic IP
     if you want to assign specific IP after VM creation -> go to vm - settings - ip configuration - then assign static ip

    <h3> what is Network interface card</h3>
    <p>
        all IP address allocate for VM does at NIC level
        when create VM all IP adress setting u see under Network Interface what NIC settings
        security also attach at NIC level.
        Topology how the connectivity happens in VM.

    <h3> Azure Secrity group</h3>
    <p> NSG (Network Secuirty group) used to encapsulare rules for azure resource, for each rule we need to provide source and destination.   
      when ever u create NSG either u can apply at aubnet level or NIC level.
      if its NIC it will just apply to the VM attached to NIC but if u apply at subnet level then all vms inside subnet will be protected. 
      best practice is give at subnet level.

      we can even add rules at subnet level and NIC Level combination as well.
    </p>
    lower rule is the priority in NSG order
    <a href ="/Assets/Nsgruleorderexample.png">In this 100 rule will be processed first its lower is first priorty</a>
    <a href ="/Assets/NSGordersample2.png">write down which rule will be processed for each sample</a>
    there are NSG inbound default rules which cant be deleted

    <h3>
      bastrain host
    </h3>
    <p>
      1. this needs dedicated subnet
      2. name always azurebastionsubnet
      3. single bastnet only single vnet
      4. Azure Bastion is a fully managed service that provides secure and seamless Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) access to virtual machines (VMs) in Azure, 
      without exposing them to the public internet, acting as a secure jump box or bastion host. 

      <p>
        POC
      1. create one window and linux vm with out public IP
      2. Create bastron host
      3. using bastron host we can connect those 2 vm even with out having public IP
