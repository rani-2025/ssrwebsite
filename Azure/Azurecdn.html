        <h3> what is CDN - Content delivery network</h3>
        -> let say forexample u have blob storage created in us east region.

        -> for example we have users from different regions ind, us, SA 
        in this scenario with out CDN if they want to download image from blob does all the users get same speed?
        ans is No - bcs each one has different network

        -> accessing blob from CDN will resolve this issue.
        in this scenario actual blob will be cached in CDN profile and accessed from CDN edge ind, cdn edge us and cdn edge and respective locations get 
        data from nearest CDN. this defintely having better performance.

        -> in above scenario if cache miss happens then it will directly hit origin then data stores in cache here first user first time bit slow 
        next time onwards its with improved performance

        CDN works on port no 3

        we can restrict cdn profile works on geo filtering means it will be accessable to only allowed filters

      </p>

        <h3> blob access tiers</h3>
        1. hottier - storage cost high, but retrival cost minimal - store frequently used data here
        2. cool tier - e.g.long term data backup, centralized data logs, quarterly financial data (storage cost less, access cost high)
         -- so store only frequently used one
         -- here 30 day locking period -- until 30 days we cant delete
        3. archival tier - lock - 180 days, store vert very frequenr access data, minimal store cost, high access cost, 
        e.g store audit complains data like-- its offline storage -- when ever u want retrieval we need to send request to azure - 
        will take 3 hrs to warm up if u need faster then we need to pay to azure- 
        if u want to delete before locking period we need to pay delete cost 

        we have option to convert one acees tier to another

        when we create storage account - default is cool

        cold tier dont worry at this time.
