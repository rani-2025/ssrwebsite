        <h3>What is shared access token </h3>
       <p>
        Lets take there was a third party they need temporary access to the account
        1. add into ad account give
        2. create a saas token which create time bound that will create limited time to get access
        3. under saas we can limit the access to one pertucular type also we can give restricted access like read only. these tokens find via storage account key
        4. refer defaultsaasacceskeys diagram where we can create default access keys but done share these due to security, only use this for ur testing purpose
        5. there are 2 keys in default keys, when one is in rotation time the other one will be used to avoid any down time
