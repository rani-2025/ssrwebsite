     <section id="limitations-on-premise">
        <h2>Limitation of On-Premise Systems</h2>
        <p>On-premise systems are often limited by hardware, scalability, and high maintenance costs. With the advent of cloud computing, these limitations can be mitigated. Some key areas to note:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Slow Data Recovery:</strong> Data recovery times are typically slower on on-premise systems compared to cloud systems that offer faster disaster recovery and redundancy features.</li>
            <li><strong>Faster Data Recovery:</strong> In the cloud, data can be restored much faster, thanks to distributed systems and backup services.</li>
