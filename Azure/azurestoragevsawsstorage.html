               Azure storage services vs Aws services

                <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator"> azure price caliculator </a>
               
                       1. Azure storage service is a cloud based service managed by microsoft
                       2. we need to create storage account to use any kind of azure storage service which are below 4 services.
                       3. there are 4 kind of storages
                          a. blob storage
                          b. file storage
                          c. table storage - (costmos db, no premium storage account for this)
                          d. queue storage - (azure storage, np premium)

                    There are various azure storage accounts
                      1. standard general purpose v2 - with this all 4 storage services we can usgae - this is recommended for most scenarios
                      2. premium block blob - only blob storage - premium blob 10 times faster than general blob but cost is more - recom - high transaction rates require low storage latency
                      3. premium file share - only file - but expensive 
                      4. premium blob share - only blob 

                      storage account should be accessed by url due to that storage account name should be unique and it should be lowercase letters
                      resource group always keep under subscription - storage account should stay under resource group
                    </p1>
                   
                    <p>
                       In all Aws services managed indipendently they dont need storgae account.
                       2. blob called as s3
                       2. file called EFS
                       3. table called as dynamic
                       4. queue called as sqs.

            <p>
                here 3 copies of data will maintained but in same zone.

           Locally Redundant Storage (LRS) replicates data within a single data center, 
           while Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS) replicates data across three separate availability zones within the same region, 
           offering higher availability and durability at a slightly higher cost.

                GRS - geo redundant storage
            </h3>
            <p>
                here there are 2 regions primary and secondary region.
                1. here 3 copies of data will maintained with in same region  (LRS)
                2. then cross region which is secondary region maintain 3 more regions (LRS) where data will be copied async 
                here primary region org will choose secondary will be chosen by azure. usually takes less than 15 min to copy from primary to secondary
            </p>
            <p>
                Geo-redundant storage (GRS) copies your data synchronously three times to one or more availability zones in the primary region using LRS. 
                It then copies your data asynchronously to a single physical location in a secondary region that is hundreds of miles away from the primary region
            </p>

                In Azure, Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage (GZRS) offers the highest level of data protection and availability by replicating data across three availability zones within the primary region 
                and then asynchronously to a single zone in a paired secondary region, 
                ensuring data durability and resilience against both zonal and regional outages
