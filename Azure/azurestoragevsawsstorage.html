                       1. Azure storage service is a cloud based service managed by microsoft
                       2. we need to create storage account to use any kind of azure storage service which are below 4 services.
                       3. there are 4 kind of storages
                          a. blob storage
                          b. file storage
                          c. table storage - (costmos db, no premium storage account for this)
                          d. queue storage - (azure storage, np premium)

                    There are various azure storage accounts
                      1. standard general purpose v2 - with this all 4 storage services we can usgae - this is recommended for most scenarios
                      2. premium block blob - only blob storage - premium blob 10 times faster than general blob but cost is more - recom - high transaction rates require low storage latency
                      3. premium file share - only file - but expensive 
                      4. premium blob share - only blob 

                      storage account should be accessed by url due to that storage account name should be unique and it should be lowercase letters
                      resource group always keep under subscription - storage account should stay under resource group

                    </ui>
                    <ul>
                       In all Aws services managed indipendently they dont need storgae account.
                       2. blob called as s3
                       2. file called EFS
                       3. table called as dynamic
                       4. queue called as sqs. 
                    </ul>
                </li>
