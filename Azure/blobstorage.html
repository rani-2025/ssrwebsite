            <p1> 
                 2 types of blob storage public and provate blobs

               <h3> public vs private blob</h3>
               <p>

                1. no authentication required any one can access public blob
                2. only the people have access can accees provate blob

                3. by default blob is private 
                4. public blob security is the one who created, azure is not responsible
                5. in case of provate security is azure responsible
                6. annonymous access enabled means its a public

               </p>

            blob soft delete ->
            1. if no soft delete enabled and user does accidental dental query it will be permanantly deleted.
            2. if softdelete option enabled for 7 days and user does accedentalquery then u  can recover object for 7 days after 7 days it will be deleted
            minimum soft delete - 1 day and max - 365 days

            disadvantage of soft delete
             1. we need to pay for storage for the deleted object until the softdelete days 

             if we delete container all the objects from the storage will be deleted
             we can keep softdelete option at blob level or at container level.

            versioning in blobs
        </h3>
        <p>
            versioning only available in blob
            Blob versioning, to automatically maintain previous versions of a blob. When blob versioning is enabled, 
            you can restore an earlier version of a blob to recover your data if it's erroneously modified or deleted.
             <a href = "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/versioning-overview"> learn here more on this</a>

             if u enable blob change feed - logs all the changes been done fir version
             enable version feed - we can track on all the changes on version

             Pros - if the latest version is corrupted we can make active of older versions select that as current version

            <h3> Life cycle management in blobs which helps to save the costs</h3>
            <ul title="Deletion After N no of days">
                <li>
                    let say if we define is version older than 7 days -> yes -> it will delete all those versions
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul title="Mpving to colder tier"></ul>
                <li>
                   we can defile lifecycle rule as -> 
                   1. if object not used for more than 30 days and this object kept in hot tier then move to cool tier
                   2. if object not used for more than 90 days and this object kept in cool tier then move to cold tier
                   3. if object not used for more than 200 days and this object kept in cold tier then move to archival tier
                   4. if object not used for more than 365 days and this object kept in archival tier then delete permanant

                what is Azure file storage - to store common files
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    1. store commonly used tools and utilities which can be acesed by developer and admin
                    2. pros - shared access - azure supports acces on smb protocol on windows, nfs on linux
                            - fully managed
                            - resiliency - extremly reliable and fault tolerance
                    3. 2 tiers available in file share 
                       1. standard - only on smb  
                       2. premium - can access on nfs and smb , premium is more faster than standard, higher the quota
