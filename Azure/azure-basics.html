                        on premis cons - 
                        1. very high intial investment to setup physical hardware 
                        2. the shipping time of servers or hardware is high which can lead to delay develop solution
                        3. due to limited set of hardware the solution is not scalable which can lead to issues like app slowness, performance issues,
                        glitches, app downtime and crashes - to support they need to buy more hardware
                        4. if usgae increases we need to increase servers and hardware which requires dedicated hardware and software team which can increase captal investment further
                        5. we need to have a backusp server to maintain stability - u can use backup caliculator (serach google) to see how much it cost depends on spped time also will consume
                         -- setting up backup and restore solution is very expensive which can lead issues while doing and recovery of data                      

                    </ui>
                    <ul>
                        cloud - pros - 
                        1. you pay as you use and server and hardware setup happend with less time
                        2. they dont dedicated set of hardware only require dedictaed set of software maintaince
                        3. increase the number of servers as needed
                        4. dedicated backup solution in azure which can handle backup smootly and u dont need to worry

                           To setup data center we need data providers
                           when ever we visit azure datacenter we need to go through highly security measures
                           There was 24/7 monitor system will monitor the 
                        1. operation area all infrastructure will be monitored
                        2. if its in us its not just us it will across all the regions which they configured and they monitor All
