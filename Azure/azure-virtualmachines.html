        <h3>Virtual machines </h3>
       <p>
       different types of virtual machines
       a,b - series for development
       d- > for QA low esage
       f - high 
       g- data bases
       h & m - hevy grade machines learning
       l & m - high configuration db 
       n -> dedicated gpu enabled 
    </p>
    <p>
        While it's difficult to pinpoint one definitive "most used" series, the D-series is widely considered a popular and well-rounded choice for general-purpose workloads in Azure, offering a good balance of CPU, memory, and storage. 
        most cheapest vm - east us where microsoft head quearter

            to increase the size of VM go to VM overview -> stop first once doesn
            under availability + scale -> size -> then go to vm series -> then do resize -> resize will chagre the amount
            as long as VM in start state it wil be charged
            to avoid charges setup autoshut down in off hours by going operations -> auto shut down -> then set the time -> u will get alerts once its shutdown
            
            There are 2 kind of ips - 1- static ip, 2- dynamic ips

            when vm create - select authentication type - password based 
            
            by default public ip - is static 
            if vm stopped called as deallocated state 

          

            POC - 
            create one dynamic and static ip vms 
            once done note their ip addresses 
            stop both of them and then start -
            now check static and dynamic ip addresses -> static ip - never change but dynamic ip will change, 
            make sure 99.99 % use static there is no specific advantage of dynamic ip over static ip

            scenRIO - LETS assume vm stop for 1 month reset vm pwd ->
           vm - help -> reset pwd 
           azure will stare uname in cache

        <h3>vm disks</h3>
        <p>when azure create it will create with 2 disks - os disk and temporary disk,
        u cant add mutliple os disks in single vm
        if windows - os disk mapped to c drive</p>
        more details refer following screenshots
        <a href = "/Assets/disksinVM.png">VM disk types</a>
        <a href="/Assets/vmdisksmoredetails.png"> More details on vm disks</a>
        
        with the VM d-series -> u can see options of localstorage -> this local storage called temporarary storage - this will vary as per vm size

        intially when create VM max u can 2 TB 

        to use VM after created -> go to VM -> click on connect then download RDP file - oncw downloaded click on rdp  - it will ask uname and pwd - once enter it will connect
        on RDP vm machine what ever stored in OS disk will exist after stop and start but it will be deleted the one stored in temp disk

        do not create partition on OS disk on VM - it will create issues 
        <a href = "/Assets/connectvm.png">Connect VM</a>

        by default tmp stored in C drive we can change to d drive by going to environment variables
        <a href = "/Assets/updatevmtempstoragedrive.png">Map temp storage</a>
    
        create new partition only with unallocated space

        <h3> vm size update</h3>
        Does azure allows to reduce size of disk? No - bcs of data loss
        at os level - we can shrink the volume but it doesnt allow to reduce size at azure level

        <p>
            how to increase size vm ->first stop vm -> 
            <a href = "/Assets/stopVM.png">How to stop VM</a>
            once completed then go to vm -> disk -> settings -> size + performance -> down u can see custom size there u can enter once done stop and start VM
            <a href = "/Assets/VMcustomsizeincrease.png">VM customsize location</a>
            once done restart VM 
            then download VM -> connect RDP ->
            once u connect RDP u still see old size on drives to see the increased size - in windows go to Diskmanagement > there u can see unallocated -> there extend (function() {
