    <h2>SQL Notes</h2>
    <section>
        <p>
            1. SQL is a structured language and its not case sensitive
            2. it contains structured data - we define types for each col.      
            3. This structure called client - server architecture
            4. server is central location where data will be stored 
            5. all client machines connected to server
            6. MS SQL - serevr (when we install) , SSMS - sql server management studio - client
            7. if server doesnt work check services - MS SQL Server - should be running
            8. odbc - open database connection - using which SSMs will connect to serevr  
            9. data stored in server in database.
            10. Relational database management system   
            11. let say in employee table - emp id - primary key if it has aadhar , pan 
            since they should be unique always we need to create them as candidate keys
            12. in primary key we cant store null but in candidate key null is allowed
            13. orphan record means it doesnt have parent record in parent table
        </p>
        <p>
            1. create database retail // it will create retail
            2. use retail -> this will allow to use retail
         </p>
         <p>
            <h2>Different ways of inserting data </h2>
            1. INSERT INTO salespeople VALUES (1002, 'Serres', 'San Jose', 0.13); 
            // adding multiple values
            2. INSERT INTO salespeople VALUES (1004, 'Motika', 'London', 0.11), (1007, 'Rifkin', 'Barcelona', 0.15), (1003, 'AxelRod', 'New York', 0.10), (1005, 'Fran', 'London', 0.26);
            // adding with given column name
            3. INSERT INTO salespeople(snum, sname, comm, city) VALUES (1008, 'Serres', 0.13, 'San Jose'); 
         </p>
         <p>
            1. select * from salespeople; // get all records // here ; not required but good practice for readability
            2. select snum, sname from salespeople; // get only 2 columns data //column wise filtering
            3. select * from salespeople where city = 'London'; // all records who live in london // row wise filter
            4. select * from salespeople where city = 'London' or city = 'new york'; // will give all records who lives in both london and newyork
            // here no and bcs one person cant stay both london and new york 

            5. select * from salespeople where city in ('London','new york') // this also gives all people lives in london also new york same  as or result; 
            6. select * from salespeople where city = 'London' and comm < 0.5 // this will result all people who lives in lodon and their comm < 0.5 // it should match both conditions
            7. select * from salespeople where (city = 'London' or city='new york') and comm < 0.5 // here it will filter london, newyork city people with comm < 0.5
            8. select * from salespeople where comm > 0.10 and comm < 0.18 // this will list all people whose comm range between 0.11 to 0.17, its above 0.10 and less tgan 18
            9. select * from salespeople where comm >= 0.10 and comm <= 0.18 // this will list all people whose comm range between 0.10 to 0.18
            10. select * from salespeople where comm between 0.10 and 0.18; //  this will list all people whose comm range between 0.11 to 0.17 same as row 8
            11. select * from salespeople where city ='London' and sname = 'peel' // this list people who lives in london and their sname should be peel

            12.update salespeople set sname = 'bob' where snum = 1001 // update always give where condition
            13. update salespeople set sname = 'bob', comm = 0.16 where snum = 1001 // both sname and comm will be  updated
            14. update salespeople set comm = 0.20 where snum in(1001, 1002) // this will update 1001 and 1002 records

            15. delete salespeople where snum = 1002 // this will delete 1002 record

            16. when we have child record we cant delete from parent table until we delete from child record

            17. select * into temp from sakespeople; // create temp table
            18. drop table temp // it will drop temp

            19. CREATE TABLE customer (  // foriegn key syntax
                cnum INT NOT NULL,
                cname VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
                city VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
                rating int not null,
                snum int NOT NULL,
                PRIMARY KEY (cnum),
                FOREIGN KEY (snum) REFERENCES salespeople(snum)
                );

            20. exec sp_help customer; // by executing sp_help stored proc will give complete details including foreign key
           
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3> where clauses</h3>
            1. fnd by
            2. groupby
            3. countby 

           
        </p>
        <p>
            1.select count(cnum) from customer // give total records 
            2 select count(cnum) as 'count of customers' from customer  // / give total records  under this alias count of customers
            
            3. select count(cnum) from customer where city = 'London' // give total records under london 

            4. select city, count(cnum) from customer group by city; // find count of customers in each city * heavily used one
            5. select rating, count(cnum) from customer group by rating; // group by first segregate then filer the data

            6.select city, count(cnum) from customer where city in ('London', 'Rome') group by city; // find the count of customers living in rome and london
            7. where - filter raw data, group by - aggregate data, having - filter aggregated data
            8. where comes before group by

            9. find count of cust in cities where customer count is 1
            select city, count(cnum) from customer group by city having count(cnum) = 1; 

            10. order by - sorting data , we can apply on raw data or aggregated data it always comes end.
            select * from customer order by city; default asc order no need to mention asc, means low to high / a - z

            select * from customer order by city desc; // high to low / z- a

            select rating, count(cnum) from customer group by rating order bt count(cnum); this do order by on aggregated count 

            10. syntax of clauses 
            where -> group by -> having-> order by 

            11. having always work with group by 


        </p>
        <p>
            Joins 
            1. inner 
            2. left
            3. right
            4. outer

            in our example - customer contains snum foriegnkey from salespeople. so here for customer salespeople is the lookup table.
            always in join give the main table then lookuptable as the order.

            <p>
                <h3>Inner join</h3>
            inner join - joins 2 tables on common values - 2 tables like a and b 
            common recors a intersection b

            select * from tableA join tableB on tableA.id = tableB.id 

            select * from customer join salespeople on customer.snum = salespeople.snum;
            here we see all columns from both tables and matching rows.

            select c.snum, sname, count(cnum) from customer c join salespeople s on c.snum = s.snum group by c.snum, sname;

            here join will execute frist, then group by, then count 
         </p>
         <p>
            <h3> left outer join </h3>

            get all data from left and mathing data from right table.
            if no match records at right table will print null with left table data 

         </p>

         <p>
            <h3> right outer join </h3>

            get all data from right and mathing data from left table.
            if no match records at left table will print null with right table data 

            select * from customer right outer join salespeople on customer.snum = salespeople.snum;
         </p>

         <p>
            <h3> full  join </h3>

            get all data from right and left hand side. like a union b - common data wont be repeated.

         </p>

        </p>

        <p>
            <h3> functions</h3>
            <p>

                2 type of functions inbuilt and userdefined 
                    1. inbuilt functions are in built programs. e.g count, sum, aggregator, string, math, date etc .. 
                    2. alwats return something.
                     
                    3. user-defined needs to be created
                    they will have round bracket
                    functions will have parameter.

                    count, sum, max, min, avg - are aggregate functions
                
            </p>
            <p>
                1. select sum(amt) as totalorders from orders; // find total amount
                2. select cnum, sum(amt) from orders group by cnum; // find orders made by each customer
                3. select customer.cnum,cname,sum(amt) as tot_order_amt from orders join customer on orders.cnum = customer.cnum group by customer.cnum,cname; // find orders made by each customer also display customer name
                4. in above query if we use alias then tablename. wont work u need to use alias
                5. in 3rd query if we want to receive whose orders most as first then we need to append same query with order by sum(amt) desc;
                select customer.cnum,cname,sum(amt) as tot_order_amt from orders join customer on orders.cnum = customer.cnum group by customer.cnum,cname order by tot_order_amt desc; // find orders made by each customer also display customer name

            (table1 join table2 on top of whole result join table 3 -- follow the order of main and look up )

            select * from orders o join customer c on o.cnum = c.cnum join salespeople s on c.snum = s.num;

            https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/string-functions-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver17
            1. select snum, upper(sname), lower(city) from salespeople;
            2. select concat(sname, city) from salespeople; // it will concat sname and city
            
            3. update salespeople set city = ' London' where snum = 1009;
              select * from salespeople where city='London'; // only give 2 even three exists due to space

              select * from salespeople where trim(city)='London'; // always recommended trim with string comparison // this will give three results  // trim function removes extra leading places at end.
            4.  select value from string_split('hello how r u', ' '); -- will split based on space

            5. substring function will take 3 params , 1. actual string, 2 nd one is starting position where u starts, 3rd one no of characters

            select SUBSTRING('hello', 1, 2) // returns he
            select SUBSTRING('habbit', 4, 3) // return bit .. 4 starting position, 3 no of characters
            select CONCAT(SUBSTRING(sname, 1, 1), ' ',SUBSTRING(city, 1, 1)) from salespeople // print frist character of sname and city in single string


            5. like command use for pattern search 
            select * from salespeople where sname like '%r%';  // find all snames which contain letter r // like command (pattern search)
        
            6. -- extract first letter from james, first letter from mark then combine with smith

            select concat(substring('james', 1, 1), ' ', substring('mark',1,1), ' ', 'smith');

            <h3> mathematical functions</h3>
            https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/mathematical-functions-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver17
            ROUND(number, decimal_places)
            Purpose:
            Rounds a number to the nearest value using standard rounding rules.

            How it works:

            If the next digit is 5 or more, round up.

            If it's less than 5, round down.

            Examples:

            ROUND(25.755, 1) → 25.8      -- Look at 2nd decimal (5), round up
            ROUND(25.415, 2) → 25.42     -- Look at 3rd decimal (5), round up
            ROUND(5.45, 1) → 5.5  
            ROUND(5.44, 1) → 5.4  
            ROUND(5.5, 0) → 6
            ⬆️ 2. CEILING(number)
            Purpose:
            Always rounds up to the next highest whole number, no matter the decimal part.

            Examples:

            CEILING(5.1) → 6  
            CEILING(5.9) → 6  
            CEILING(-5.1) → -5    -- Still "up" toward zero
            ⬇️ 3. FLOOR(number)
            Purpose:
            Always rounds down to the previous whole number, regardless of the decimal.

            Examples:

            FLOOR(5.9) → 5  
            FLOOR(5.1) → 5  
            FLOOR(-5.1) → -6    -- Down (further from zero)
            🧠 Interview Tip:
            "ROUND() gives you the nearest value based on regular rounding rules.
            CEILING() always rounds up (toward positive infinity).
            FLOOR() always rounds down (toward negative infinity).
            These functions are especially useful in billing, pagination, or quantity calculations where direction of rounding matters."**
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3> few more math functions</h3>
            select round(25.95, 1); -- round up to 2 decimals .. 26.00

            select square(9); -- 81

            select sqrt(81); -- 9

            select power(2,3); -- 8

            select pi() * square(7);  -- area of circle - radius 7

            select round(pi() * square(7), 0);  -- area of circle - radius 7 -- 154
