            salesforce admin we going to learn how do we going to make changes to salesforce application.
            here Admin is the one who builds the application
            end user - who uses those (business user / customer who provdes requirements)
            with the salesforce u can configure ur app(declarative means drag and drop, no programming) by salesforce admin/app builder, customize the app (pro code(Apex), UI design (VF, LWC) by salesforce developer)
          salesforce adm 201(this is recommanded certificate ), salesforce platform app builder

          <h3> Salesforce commerce cloud</h3>
          1. front end javascript knowedge enough
          2. fir backend we need appbuilder and salesforce developer knowledge 
          trailhead account we can explore

          e.g - sudha needs a laptop she goes and buy from croma (local ) companay here croma is seller and sudha is buyer it is -> b2c transaction
          now - croma needs to buy laptops from vendor called Dell here dell is the seller , croma is the buyer - called b2b transaction - here dell needs CRM

          usecase - sudha wants buy laptops for company around 100 people, she visits HP, dell
          them Dell -
          responsibility of sales rep to carryforward lead info(sudha info),
          sales rep will ask - firstname(sudha), lastname(s), mobile(12345555), company(link.com), address(tx), industry(communications), annual revenue(134000)
          here - actual customer is link.com to dell(seller) means B2B transaction.

          once link.com converts to customer sudha info and comp info will be disintegrated (under first name and lastname as lead) convert to contact as below
          link.com info will be entered under Account ->

          Account -> Name(link.com) , Industry(communications), Annual revenue(134000), contact (is the person who is responsible doing business with company)
          Contact - firstname(sudha), lastname(s), mobile(12345555)
          Oppurtunity - Name (150 laptops) - an oppurtunity is potential revenue generating event

          in reality if u want to buy  licensed version u need to have authorized spark (in above case - sudha)

          if the lead sead they not going to buy then sales person change status to cold and update Lead status as not converted

         <h3> How Marketing-> Sales -> Service work to gether on scenarion </h3>
          <p>
            scenario : if oppurtunity - jyoti here - comes and told want to buy ur new product whivh wasnt released yet
            then sales guy reaches the product manager --> and try to 
            create new product -> under sales ->  where product family not available then he reaches sales admin -> he goes object manager --> add new field of product family
            under fields 
            after that he can create poduct with family
            then need to add price by click on add to Price book
            there are 2 type of prices -> standard and list price -- standard bare mimimal price to buy the product 

            creare product with price
            then sales team go and create opputunity with that product 
          </p>
          <p>
            Now jyoti see total price where she wants to negotiate the price ->
            then she will go and get the quotes 
            then this is how sales team create quote->
            go to search quote -> sales -> quotes -> create quote
            once quote created they have an option to create pdf and send an email (quote is commitment from sales)
          </p>
          <p> then jyoti and sales team agreed between few terms and aggrements and signed on contract

            ten sales will go and create contract -> search -> new contract -> then it had contract number - 
            jyoti use this number and issue a purchase order the format will be shared by sales team(purchase order is aggrement from buyer)
          </p>
          <p>
            then sales guy go head and create new order -> sales -> order -> new order -> once done sales will go and activate the order -> then sales force work is done
          </p>
          <p>
            after this external system fulfill the order and executed 
          </p>
          <p>
            after this sales guy wants to keep track of order order by logging -> go to assets -> add assets with all this order details 
          </p>
          <p>
            lets say there is a problem with order -> sales guy go to asset -> create a case with the issue details -> then service agent can see the case and act on it
          </p>
          <p>
            one sales person cant see other sales person data but manager can see all his team members data
          </p>

          1. fields
          2. objects
          3. navigation
        </p>
          <p>
            In Salesforce u have 2 apps
            1. standard app - standard , custom fields
            2. custom app - 4 standard , custom fields (name, created by, owner, last modified by - standard fields, Name is the hyperlink by default)
            3. standard fields
            4. custom fields 
          </p>
          <p>
            in Salesforce admin following tabs are available each tab open related objects
            Tab name is plural and object name is singular always.
            1. oppurtunites -> open opputunity object
            2. quotes - open quote object
            3. leads - open lead object
            4. Accounts - open account object
            5. Contacts - open contact object
          </p>
          <p>
            In Salesforce, the "Rating" field on the Account object is a standard field used to classify the quality or priority of a potential or existing customer. While Salesforce provides default values, organizations often customize this field or add additional custom rating types to suit their specific business needs.

            -Default Rating Field (Standard Salesforce Setup)
            By default, the Rating picklist on the Account object typically includes these values:

            Hot  High-priority account; likely to buy soon or very valuable.

            Warm - Medium-priority; shows interest but needs nurturing.

            Cold - Low-priority; little or no engagement currently.

            These are usually used in lead qualification, account scoring, or sales prioritization
          </p>
          <p>
            <h3> Navigation types</h3>
            <p> standard navigation - default navigation - each click control moves to different tab</p>
            <p> 
              console navigation - it will be useed mostly by call center apps - here all tabs comes under one view 
              This is performance impacted - reason is each tab opens under thred with this view we going to have parent and child threads
            </p>
