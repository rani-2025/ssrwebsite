        standard profiles --
          systemadim
          standard user
          standard platform user

        never ever change anything in standard profile always create custom profile


        steps -> create custom profiles
              1. for standarduser - custom su,
                 for standard platform user - custom spu,
                 along with this create jsr and legal profiles.

      <p>
        <h3>
          helpfule note to access ur account across globe
        </h3>
        <p>
          go tp user profiles - select ur profile -> add Login IP ranges -> 0.0.0.0 -> start address
                                                      255.255.255.255 -> end address

          in world all ip addrss fall between this range if we do this any one across globe knows my username and password
          can access my account other wise it always ask 2 factor authentication

       1.  secuity - object level, record level, field level
       2. profiles define the accessibility of data to users and the actions that can be performed by the users within the application.
       when we create users will assign profile to each one.
       3. 2 type of profiles- standard/ custom

       There are various type of standard profiles
         1. readonly, standarduser, marketinguser, contract manager, solution manager, system administrator.
          2. custom profiles created by adimn, if no users assigned to this then the profile will be deleted.
    
    permission set is a collection of permissions and settings that allow users to perform certain actions in salesforce.
    all users with sameprofile will see sane UI but the data they see might be different.

        <h3>creating custon profile</h3>

          1. search -> profile -> user profiles -> select standard profile -> click on clone -> enter ur profile name and save
        </p>
      </section>

        <h3>creating users and permission sets --</h3>
        <p>
          1. search -> users -> select users -> click om new user (no hirarchy at this point every one is individual uset)
          firname, lastname, nickname, email, username, license, profile 
        </p>
        <p>
          
          1. we can create multiple permission sets
          also create permission set group with multiple permission sets
        </p>
        <p>
          1.(org)organization wide details - object level - public read/write, public read only, private, controlled by parent, public read/write/transfer
          2.Manual sharing - record level - if test 1 goes on vacation they can do manual assignment to other user at record level
          3.permission sets, permission set groups - helps to over write org permissions
          4.Roles 
            <p>
              <h3>user roles - this is to define role hirarchy</h3>
              <p>
                1. quick finder - users -> roles -> setup roles (legal team is a seperate role al together)
                2. then go to users -> edit one of the user -update the role
                as per the role -> they can see the records
              </p>
          </p>
          5. share settings -> new rule -> add criteria -> e.g industry equals biotech
                                                                industry equals chemical
                                                                select users share with -> select role -> legal -> then legal team can see all records
       
          6. for approval process -> filds & relations -> create picklist filed -with approve reject, other field text area with some comments
          7. now for sales manager can do any edits to the records to prevent this -> page layout -> account layout -> make legal status and comments read only 
          8. restrict the user what users can see or not
