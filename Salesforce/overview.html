          <h3> Salesforce commerce cloud</h3>
          1. front end javascript knowedge enough
          2. fir backend we need appbuilder and salesforce developer knowledge 
          trailhead account we can explore

          e.g - sudha needs a laptop she goes and buy from croma (local ) companay here croma is seller and sudha is buyer it is -> b2c transaction
          now - croma needs to buy laptops from vendor called Dell here dell is the seller , croma is the buyer - called b2b transaction - here dell needs CRM

          usecase - sudha wants buy laptops for company around 100 people, she visits HP, dell
          them Dell -
          responsibility of sales rep to carryforward lead info(sudha info),
          sales rep will ask - firstname(sudha), lastname(s), mobile(12345555), company(link.com), address(tx), industry(communications), annual revenue(134000)
          here - actual customer is link.com to dell(seller) means B2B transaction.

          once link.com converts to customer sudha info and comp info will be disintegrated (under first name and lastname as lead) convert to contact as below
          link.com info will be entered under Account ->

          Account -> Name(link.com) , Industry(communications), Annual revenue(134000), contact (is the person who is responsible doing business with company)
          Contact - firstname(sudha), lastname(s), mobile(12345555)
          Oppurtunity - Name (150 laptops) - an oppurtunity is potential revenue generating event

          in reality if u want to buy  licensed version u need to have authorized spark (in above case - sudha)

          if the lead sead they not going to buy then sales person change status to cold and update Lead status as not converted
