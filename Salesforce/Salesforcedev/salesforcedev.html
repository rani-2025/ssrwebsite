       OOPS
      </h3>
      <p>
       in salesforce all around oops concept
       1. class is a blueprint 
       2. Instance is a in memory representation of a class.
       2. class includes attributes and functionality
       3. parent and child relation will be created using - inheritance
       4. depending on the input behaviour is called - polymorphisam
       5. accssmodifier - controls the visbility or accesslevel at  class or method level
          class level - public , private 
          method level- public, private, protected and default
      6. variable is a memory location capable of storing data of a particular type
         variable is a memory location capable of pointing to other memory location.
         it has its own datatype.
         for optimam memory mgt we need to define every variable to be of a particular datatype.
         the data types are classified
         primitive -- integer, string, date, boolean
         non-primitive -- sobject, list, set, map 
      
         let say if we delare variable at class level - called as instance variables
         these are available to all methods in class.
         these are kind Let - variable one place changes will be available to subsequent methods.

         in methodoverloading or overriding case variable will be instantiated then after its been initialized.
         but with constructor variable will initalized at the time of creating itself.
        constructor is the special method with the same name as that of a class. its need not be explictitly called using instance variable, 
        instead it automatically initalized as soon as instanse created.

        by default default constructor will be created . for example if we override passing prams to constructor u must need define default constrtuctor

        public class test1()
        {
          public test1() {}
          public test1(inetger a, integer b)
          {
            c= a+b;
            system.debug(c)
          }
        }


        7. this is how swicth syntx looks in salesforce
        // here in switch it wont allow when i> 10 always needs value
        public static void methodSwitch() {
          integer i = I0;
          Switch on i {
            When 1,2,3,4 {
              system.debug('The value of i is less than 5');
            }
            when 6,7,8,9 {
              system.debug('The value of i less than 6');
            }
          }
        }

        8. do while -> always do executes fist then go to while until satisfies in realtime we mostly does at enter username and password conditions.
        while, swicth case

      <h3> List, Set and Map</h3>
      Set exactly same as list but doesnt allow duplicates.
      <p>
        List - 
          a. its a collection of ordered elements.
          b. allows duplicates
          c. its a dynamically sized variable
          List <integer> l = new List </integer> ();
          integer range = Integer.ValueOf(math.random() * 10)
          integer val ;
          for(integer k = 0; k < range; k++){
            val = Integer.ValueOf(math.random()*10);
            l.add(val);
          }
          System.debug('Random number generated is...' +range);
          System.debug('the values in the list are...' );
          for(integer k=0; k < range; k++)
          {
            System.debug(l[k]);
          }

      </p>
      <p>
        Set - wont allow duplicates
        Set<Integer> s = new Set<Integer>();
          List<Integer> l = new List<Integer>();
          Integer range = Integer.ValueOf(Math.random() * 10);
          Integer val ;
           for(integer k = 0; k < range; k++){
             val = Integer.ValueOf(math.random()*10);
             s.add(val);
             l.add(val);
           }
           System.debug('Random number generated is...' +range);
           System.debug('the values in the set are...'+s );
           System.debug('the values in the list are...'+l );
      </p>
      <p>
        Map - 
        In Salesforce Apex, a Map is a collection of key–value pairs where each key is unique, and each key maps to a single value.
        Think of it like a dictionary: you look up data by a key instead of by position (like in a List).

        Map<String, Integer> studentScores = new Map<String, Integer>();
        studentScores.put('Alice', 90);
        studentScores.put('Bob', 85);
        System.debug(studentScores.get('Alice')); // 90
        System.debug(studentScores.containsKey('Bob')); // true

      <h3>
        what is SOSL?
      </h3>
      SOSL = Salesforce Object Search Language
      It’s used to search text across multiple objects and fields at the same time, similar to the global search in Salesforce.
      there was third party tool called - workforce using which we can write SOSL.

        What is SOQL?
      </h3>
       List<Account> alist = new List<Account>();
        alist = [SELECT Name, Industry From Account];
        for(Account a: alist){
            System.debug('Account...'+a.Name+'...Industry...'+a.Industry);
