        business process workflow (deprecated)
        process builder
        flow (present and future)

        case --
        annual revenue greater that  100 thousand set rating filed to 
        120 - rating hot
        100 - rating warm
        90 - cold

        business process workflow - 4 actions - one object only
        process builder - 11 actions - one object and detail / child objects
        Flow - (unlimited) - multiple actions, multiple objects related or unrelated

        approval workflow - 

        requirement -
        1. creates an account (assume JSR -> sr -> smn-> sd)
        2. Annual revenue greater than equal to 120 milion - no approval 
        3. Annual revenue greater than equal to 100 milion - mgr approval (here if sr approves only goes to mgr approval)
        4. Annual revenue greater than equal to 90 milion - sr approval 
        5. Annual revenue greater than equal to 60 milion - sr -> sm -> sd (approvals required)
        here only if sr approves go to sm after his approval goes to sd -> this is known sequential approval process

        let say Ar >= 100 then only goes at same time called SR/SM/SD -> parallel approval process (there are 2 approval processes in this)

        1. unanimous -> means all must approves in workflow
        2. firstapproval/ rejection -> in this who ever does the first action (approve/ reject) is considered

        now create 
        annual revenue >=100 - SR - sequential
        AR >= 90 -> SR -> sequential after his approval -> should go to SD/SM -> at parallel
