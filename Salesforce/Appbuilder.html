          In salesforce there are objects where we dont need a tab (e.g. Membership object)
          1. going to create HR App
          part of it 
          we have AppName - HR Onboarding
          objects - Employee, Department, Device, Club, Membership
          Tab -     Employees, Departments, Devices, Clubs , N/A 
          what does each object do?
        
          2. home -> app launcher -> hr onboarding wont visible by deafult -> go to -> settings userprofile -> add system admin -> then it will be visible

          home -> app launcher -> vew all -> u can see all apps
          
        </p>
        <p>
          Relationships (always look relationships from right to left)
          e.g -> employee -> departments (its going to one to one)
          Department -> employees (many to one)
          employee -> device (one to many)
          employee -> club, club -> employee  (Many to Many)
        </p>

        <h3> how to create custom object</h3>
        1.  object manager -> schema builder -> custom object/ custom object from excel spread sheet --> here schema bulder -> custom object 90 % usage
        steps -> select custom object -> label - employee, plural label - employees(tab names), record name - is the field going to be hyperlink
        object is not assigned to any profile - while creating
        to show under tab -> we need to assign profile 

        2. we can assign to be profiles as well as application

        custom object from excel  -> should be csv file

        as soon as new object created 4 default fields will be created
        a. first name, created by, owner, lasmodified by (by default name field will be hyperlink )

        go to objectmanager -> select object -> select fields & relationships where u can create new field
        filed is assigned to pagelayout and profile
