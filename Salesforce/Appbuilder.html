          In salesforce there are objects where we dont need a tab (e.g. Membership object)
          1. going to create HR App
          part of it 
          we have AppName - HR Onboarding
          objects - Employee, Department, Device, Club, Membership
          Tab -     Employees, Departments, Devices, Clubs , N/A 
          what does each object do?
        
          2. home -> app launcher -> hr onboarding wont visible by deafult -> go to -> settings userprofile -> add system admin -> then it will be visible

          home -> app launcher -> vew all -> u can see all apps
          
        </p>
        <p>
          Relationships (always look relationships from right to left)

          Department -> employees (many to one)
          employee -> device (one to many)

        <h3> how to create custom object</h3>
        1.  object manager -> schema builder -> custom object/ custom object from excel spread sheet --> here schema bulder -> custom object 90 % usage
        steps -> select custom object -> label - employee, plural label - employees(tab names), record name - is the field going to be hyperlink
        object is not assigned to any profile - while creating
        to show under tab -> we need to assign profile 

        2. we can assign to be profiles as well as application

        custom object from excel  -> should be csv file

        as soon as new object created 4 default fields will be created - field name always start with capital letter
        a. first name, created by, owner, lasmodified by (by default name field will be hyperlink )

        go to objectmanager -> select object -> select fields & relationships where u can create new field
        filed is assigned to pagelayout and profile

        by default for each tan it shows recently viewed data in list view format this default format only can be changed by system admin only.

        <h3>while loading data using dataloader following is the format we need to follow in csv file</h3>
        1. when created a filed and click on hyperlink u can id in url which is generated by salesforce u can this id as key when u do update, delete, upsert operations from csv file.
        2. in salesforce - the one defined in statement 1 considered as id , what ever unique field  in object going to be defined as e.g mobileno then that that should be listed under
        mobileno -External ID
        3. for insert / export no ID required but other operations we need to ID.
        4. the ID will get created only when insert operation happens.
        5. let say for example in csv u define ID for few records and no ID assigned for few, then it will treat what ever record had ID it will consider as update 
        remaining it will treat as insert.
        6. let say id we delete any records -> go to recycle in dataloader -> and do un delete -> it will restore the data
